The code provided uses MPI (Message Passing Interface) to parallelize the task of calculating forces between particles across multiple processes. 
This approach divides the workload among the processes to achieve load balancing, so each process only handles a subset of particles instead of all particles.

In this code, each process calculates the force acting on its assigned range of particles based on their positions relative to all other particles.
The calculation follows the formula: force = CONST1 / distance^3 - CONST2 * SIGN(distance) / (distance^2), where distance is the positional difference 
between two particles. The constants CONST1 and CONST2 help determine the strength and direction of the force.

To manage the workload efficiently, the program divides the particles into segments (or ranges) that are distributed evenly across the available processes.
Each process has a `start_index` and `end_index` that determine its segment of particles, ensuring that the workload remains balanced among processes.

After each process has completed its calculations, the results (forces) from all processes are combined using an MPI function, `MPI_Allreduce`.
This function aggregates the computed forces across processes with a time complexity of O(n log_2 p), where `n` is the total number of particles and `p` is the number of processes.
This method ensures that communication cost does not become a bottleneck as the number of processes grows, allowing the solution to remain scalable.

The root process then prints the final accumulated force values for each particle. This design effectively minimizes the computation load on individual processes
while keeping the communication cost low, making the solution efficient for scenarios involving a large number of particles and processors.
